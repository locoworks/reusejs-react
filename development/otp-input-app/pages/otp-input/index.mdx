## List of exported Components:

### HeadlessOtpInput 

This is the OTP input component with no inherit styles. user will have to provide styles to the component.

In this OTP input component, we can pass  number of inputs with the prop `numInputs`.

We need to use the HTML input element to render the boxes. if we need to add a wrapper to input components with help of renderInput prop. 

Here is the list of all available props for the HeadlessOtpInput

`numInputs:number`: Number of OTP inputs to be rendered.

`renderInput:function`: A function that returns the input that is supposed to be rendered for each of the input fields. The function will get two arguments: `inputProps` and index. `inputProps` is an object that contains all the props that should be passed to the input being rendered index is the index of the input being rendered.

`onChange:function`: Returns OTP code typed in inputs.

`value: string/number`: The value of the OTP passed into the component.

`placeholder:string`: Specify an expected value of each input. The length of this string should be equal to numInputs.

`renderSeparator:component/function`: Provide a custom separator between inputs by passing a component. For instance, <span>-</span> would add - between each input.

`containerStyle:style (object)/className (string)`: Style applied or class passed to container of inputs.

`inputStyle:style (object)/className (string)`: Style applied or class passed to each input.

### ReuseOtpInput

The **`ReuseOtpInput`** component extends the functionality of **`HeadlessOtpInput`** by providing additional features and default styling options, which can be overridden to customize components according to your specific use case.

User can pass the custom styles using this prop `inputClassName: "w-12 h-14 bg-slate-300 border rounded-xl text-2xl font-semibold"`. 

By leveraging these props, users can fully customize the **ReuseOtpInput** component to suit their specific requirements and design preferences.

Automatically populate the OTP field when the user copies the OTP from an SMS and selects it from the keypad, eliminating the need for manual input.

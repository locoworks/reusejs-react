## ReuseJS useIsoMorphicEffect

## Overview

The `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook is a custom hook that offers an isomorphic (server-client) effect based on the execution environment. This hook allows you to specify an effect function to be executed, along with an optional array of dependencies.

The key advantage of the `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook lies in its ability to seamlessly adapt to different execution environments. In server-side rendering (SSR) contexts, it employs the `useEffect` hook for effect management. Conversely, in client-side rendering (CSR) environments, it utilizes the `useLayoutEffect` hook. This intelligent selection of effect hooks ensures uniform behavior and proper synchronization between server-rendered content and client-side updates.

By incorporating the `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook into your codebase, you can maintain consistent and reliable effects execution while accommodating the specific needs of server and client rendering scenarios.

## Installation
```
yarn add @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
or 
npm install @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
```

## External Dependencies
No External Dependencies

## Importing
```jsx
import {useIsoMorphicEffect} from "@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks";
```

## Input Parameters

- `effect` (Function): The effect function to be executed.
- `deps` (Array): An optional array of dependencies for the effect.

## Usage/Examples

1. Import `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook to your React project:

```jsx
import { useIsoMorphicEffect } from '@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks';
```

2. To utilize the `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook, import it into your React component and call it with your effect function and dependencies. The hook will handle the underlying effect hook selection, ensuring that the effect is executed appropriately in both server-side and client-side environments.

```jsx
useIsoMorphicEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic here
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

3. It's recommended to provide the necessary dependencies in the `deps` array to control the effect's re-execution. Omitting the `deps` parameter will cause the effect to be executed on every render.

By leveraging the `useIsoMorphicEffect` hook, you can write React components with effects that function consistently and correctly across different rendering scenarios, enhancing the reliability and predictability of your application.

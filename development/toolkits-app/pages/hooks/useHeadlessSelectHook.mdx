## ReuseJS useHeadlessSelectHook

## Overview

The `useHeadlessSelectHook` is a custom hook designed to create a headless select component in React. It provides a convenient way to manage the state and functionality of the select component, including options, selection, filtering, and handling outside clicks.

## Installation
```
yarn add @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
or 
npm install @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
```

## External Dependencies
No External Dependencies

## Importing
```jsx
import {useHeadlessSelectHook} from "@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks";
```

## Input Parameters

- options (Array of Objects): An array of objects representing the available options in the select component. Each option object can have any number of key-value pairs, but it must contain the valueKey specified as a parameter to identify the value of the option.

- valueKey (String): The key in the options objects that represents the value.

- onChange (Function, optional): A callback function that will be called whenever the selected values in the select component change. It receives the selected option(s) as an argument.

- filterFunction (Function, optional): A custom filter function to define how the options should be filtered based on a query. This function takes an option object and the current query as parameters and should return a boolean indicating whether the option matches the query or not.

- clearQuery (Boolean): By default, when the select component is closed, the query is cleared unless the clearQuery parameter is set to false.

- defaultSelected (Array): An array of option objects corresponding to the desired default selection.

- defaultOpen (Boolean): Control the initial open state of the select component. Set it to true if you want the select component to be initially open, or false otherwise.

- defaultQuery (String): Specify a default query for filtering the options when the component is initialized.

- refresh (Any): If you want to trigger a refresh of the select component based on a certain dependency, you can pass that dependency as the refresh parameter. Whenever the refresh value changes, the select component will be refreshed.

## Return Types

An object containing the state and functions of the headless select component.

- `open` (boolean): The current open state of the select component.
- `setOpen` (function): Function to update the open state of the select component.
- `query` (string): The current query used for filtering the options.
- `setQuery` (function): Function to update the query for filtering the options.
- `selectedValues` (Array): The currently selected values in the select component.
- `setSelectedValues` (function): Function to update the selected values.
- `filteredOptions` (Array): The options that match the current query.
- `setFilteredOptions` (function): Function to update the filtered options.
- `addOrRemove` (function): Function to add or remove selected values based on the multiple selection mode.
- `outsideClickRef` (React.MutableRefObject): Ref object for handling outside clicks to close the select component.

## Usage/Examples

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useHeadlessSelectHook } from '@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Define options, valueKey, and other necessary variables

  // Use the useHeadlessSelectHook
  const {
    open,
    setOpen,
    query,
    setQuery,
    selectedValues,
    setSelectedValues,
    filteredOptions,
    setFilteredOptions,
    addOrRemove,
    outsideClickRef
  } = useHeadlessSelectHook({
    options,
    valueKey,
    onChange,
    filterFunction,
    clearQuery,
    defaultSelected,
    defaultOpen,
    defaultQuery,
    refresh
  });

  // Return JSX and handle events using the hook's state and functions

  return (
    // JSX for the headless select component
  );
};
```

In this example, you can use the `useHeadlessSelectHook` to manage the state and functionality of a headless select component. You can customize the behavior of the select component by providing options, valueKey, onChange callback, filterFunction, and other optional parameters. The hook provides the necessary state variables and functions to handle the select component's behavior.

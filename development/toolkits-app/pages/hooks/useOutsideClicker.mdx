## Reusejs Use Outside Clicker

The `useOutsideClicker` hook is a custom hook that enables the detection of clicks outside a specified element and triggers a callback function accordingly.

### **Parameters**

- `callback` (Function): The callback function to be invoked when an outside click is detected.

### **Return Value**

- `visRef` (React.MutableRefObject): A mutable ref object that should be assigned to the component or element that you want to track for outside clicks.

### **Description**

The `useOutsideClicker` hook sets up an event listener on the document to capture click events. It compares the clicked element with the specified element's ref (`visRef`) and invokes the provided `callback` function if the click occurred outside the specified element.

### **Usage**

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const outsideClickRef = useOutsideClicker(() => {
    // Callback logic here
  });

  return <div ref={outsideClickRef}>...</div>;
};
```

To utilize the `useOutsideClicker` hook, assign the returned `visRef` to the component or element that you want to track for outside clicks. When a click occurs outside that element, the provided `callback` function will be invoked.

Ensure that you assign the `visRef` to the appropriate component or element using the `ref` attribute.

The `useOutsideClicker` hook provides a convenient way to handle outside clicks in React components, allowing you to implement custom behaviors, such as closing menus or modals, whenever a user clicks outside a specific element.

## ReuseJS useOutsideClicker

## Overview
The `useOutsideClicker` hook is a custom hook that facilitates the detection of clicks outside of a designated element, triggering a specified callback function in response.

This hook simplifies the process of monitoring click events and their targets. By employing the `useOutsideClicker` hook, an event listener is established on the document itself. Whenever a click event occurs, the hook compares the clicked element with the reference of the designated element (`visRef`). Should the click fall outside the specified element, the provided `callback` function is invoked.

## Installation
```
yarn add @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
or 
npm install @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks
```

## External Dependencies
No External Dependencies

## Importing
```jsx
import {useOutsideClicker} from "@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks";
```

## Input Parameters

- `callback` (Function): The callback function to be invoked when an outside click is detected.

## Return Types

- `visRef` (React.MutableRefObject): A mutable ref object that should be assigned to the component or element that you want to track for outside clicks.

## Usage/Examples

1. Import `useOutsideClicker` hook to your react project.

```jsx
import { useOutsideClicker } from '@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks';
```

2. To utilize the `useOutsideClicker` hook, assign the returned `visRef` to the component or element that you want to track for outside clicks. When a click occurs outside that element, the provided `callback` function will be invoked.
```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const outsideClickRef = useOutsideClicker(() => {
    // Callback logic here
  });

  return <div ref={outsideClickRef}>...</div>;
};
```

3. Ensure that you assign the `visRef` to the appropriate component or element using the `ref` attribute.

The `useOutsideClicker` hook provides a convenient way to handle outside clicks in React components, allowing you to implement custom behaviors, such as closing menus or modals, whenever a user clicks outside a specific element.

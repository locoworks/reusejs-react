## Headless Button
This is the button component with no inherent styles, so to render this component user will have to provide styles to the component.

This Button provides the feature of adding **busy state**, **busy text** which will be shown in busy state, ability to add button **Prefix** and button **Suffix**.

It uses following tailwind classes for providing styles: ** ``` w-1/2 bg-red-400 hover:bg-red-500 py-2 rounded-lg text-white font-bold ``` **

<HeadlessSample/>

## Sample Code Demo
This is the sample styles included when you return **ReuseButton** as shown in the demo code. It has the features of setting the **busy state** and the **busy text** which will be visible when in **busy state**.
<Sample/>

```js path=../../components/button/Sample name=Sample

## Outline Button Demo
This is a simple ReuseButton with the styling of **border-2 border-blue-600 bg-transparent font-bold text-blue-600 py-1 px-2** to give it a **transparent button** look with outlines. It can be suitable for situations where a more subdued visual appearance is desired while still maintaining the interactive nature of a button.

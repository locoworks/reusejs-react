## Overview

This Button component documentation serves as a visual reference and demonstration of different button styles and configurations available for use in your application. It aims to provide inspiration and guidance in selecting and implementing buttons that align with your design requirements and user experience goals.

This page has **multiple button styles** and **interactive button samples** along with their **Code snippets** which you can include in your projects.
The code snippets are available in **TypeScript** as well as **JavaScript**.

## Headless Button
This is the button component with no inherent styles, so to render this component user will have to provide styles to the component.

This Button provides the feature of adding **busy state**, **busy text** which will be shown in busy state, ability to add button **Prefix** and button **Suffix**.

It uses following tailwind classes for providing styles: ** ``` w-1/2 bg-red-400 hover:bg-red-500 py-2 rounded-lg text-white font-bold ``` **

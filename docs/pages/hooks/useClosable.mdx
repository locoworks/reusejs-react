# Reusejs Use Closable HOC

import SiteWrapper from "../../components/support/SiteWrapper.tsx"
import toc from "../../../data/useClosable-toc.json"

## Overview

The `Closable` Higher-Order Component (HOC) enhances a wrapped component by adding closable behavior to it. It automatically closes the wrapped component after a specified timeout, if provided, and invokes a callback function when the component is closed.

## Installation

To use the `Closable` HOC, you need to have React and its dependencies installed in your project. This HOC is the part of react toolkit so install `npm install @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks`
To install Hooks into your code base use following command `yarn add @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks` or `npm install @locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks`

## External Dependencies

No External Dependencies

## Importing

You can import the hook from the installed library, **@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks**
```jsx
import { useClosableComponent as Closable,} from "@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks"
```

## Input Parameters

- `Component` (React.Component): The component to be wrapped with closable behavior.

## Return Types

- (React.Component): The enhanced component with closable behavior.

## Usage Example

### Closable as Wrapper Example

```jsx
import { useClosableComponent as Closable } from "@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks"

// Suppose we have a component named MyComponent that needs to be closable
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent"; // Replace with the actual path to your component

// Wrap MyComponent with the Closable HOC
const ClosableMyComponent = Closable(MyComponent);

// Use the enhanced ClosableMyComponent as you would normally use MyComponent
```

### Closable with resolve and timeout

Suppose you have a custom component named `Notification` that you want to make closable with a timeout. The `Notification` component might look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Notification = ({ message }) => {
  return <div className="notification">{message}</div>;
};

export default Notification;
```

Now, you can wrap the `Notification` component with the `Closable` HOC to add closable behavior:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Closable from "./Closable"; // Replace with the actual path to the Closable HOC file
import Notification from "./Notification"; // Replace with the actual path to your Notification component

const ClosableNotification = Closable(Notification);

const App = () => {
  const handleNotificationClose = (closedDueToTimeout) => {
    if (closedDueToTimeout) {
      console.log("Notification automatically closed due to timeout");
    } else {
      console.log("Notification manually closed");
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      {/* Render the ClosableNotification with the resolve and timeout props */}
      <ClosableNotification
        message="This is a closable notification with a timeout of 3 seconds."
        timeout={3000} // Set the timeout to 3 seconds
        resolve={handleNotificationClose}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we create an `App` component that renders the `ClosableNotification` component. The `ClosableNotification` is wrapped with the `Closable` HOC, and we pass the `timeout` prop with a value of `3000` (3 seconds) to specify the duration after which the notification should automatically close. We also provide the `resolve` prop with the `handleNotificationClose` callback function, which will be called when the notification is closed.

When the app is run, the `ClosableNotification` will automatically close after 3 seconds, and the `handleNotificationClose` function will be called with `true` to indicate that the closure was due to the timeout. If the user manually closes the notification before the timeout, the `handleNotificationClose` function will be called with `false`.

## Best Practices

- Use the `Closable` HOC when you need to add closable behavior to a component that should automatically close after a specific timeout.

## Notes

- The `Closable` HOC is useful for components that need to be automatically closed after a certain duration or when a specific action occurs.
- Make sure to provide the necessary props to the wrapped component, such as `timeout` and `resolve`, as described in the usage example.

  return <SiteWrapper toc={toc}><div className="prose max-w-full mx-4 pb-10" >{children}</div></SiteWrapper>

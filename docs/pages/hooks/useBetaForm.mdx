## Reusejs BetaForm

**BetaForm** is custom React hook for form handling and validation. It exports a function that can be used to create a form state object with various form-related functionalities.

### Functionalities

This custom hook provides the following functionalities:

- `value`: The current form values stored in the value state.
- `setValue`: A function to update the form values.
- `errors`: An object that manages form errors, likely provided by the useBetaErrors hook.
- `busy`: A boolean indicating if the form is currently in a busy/processing state.
- `setValidationRules`: A function to set the validation rules for the form.
- `validate`: A function to trigger form validation based on the defined validation rules.
- `validateSingleField`: A function to validate a single field in the form based on its value and specific rules.
- `setField`: A function to set a field value in the form state using dot-separated path notation.
- `startProcessing`: A function to indicate the start of form processing by resetting errors and setting the form as busy.
- `finishProcessing`: A function to indicate the completion of form processing by setting the form as not busy and successful.
- `resetStatus`: A function to reset the form status by clearing errors and setting the form as not busy and not successful.
- `setErrors`: A function to set form errors manually.
- `pushError`: A function to add an error to the form errors.
- `forgetErrors`: A function to clear all form errors.
- `removeError`: A function to remove a specific error from the form errors.
- `getField`: A function to retrieve the value of a specific field in the form state using dot-separated path notation.
This hook provides a convenient way to manage form state, handle form validation, and track form processing status in React applications.

## Usage

### How to Import BetaForm?

Betaform is a part of **@locoworks/reusejs-toolkit-react-hooks** hence it can be imported from as a hook. Following is the sysntax for importing BetaFoprm.
> Notice the useBetaForm syntax which is a hook hence starts with *use*

```js
import { useBetaForm } from "@locoworks/reusejs-roolkit-react-hooks";
```

### How to use BetaForm?

BetaForm takes an object as input and provides state for value, errors and functions such as validation, processing etc. I t also allows us to get and set individual values for the form field and use getField and setField functions to create controlled form inputs.
Following is the syntax to define a Betaform

```js
import {useBetaForm} from "@locoworks/reusejs-roolkit-react-hooks";

const form = useBetaForm({
  name: ""
  email: ""
  phone: ""
})
```

We can also map constaints to individual keys using validate.js. A sample is shown below:

```js
const constraints = {
    name: {
      presence: { allowEmpty: false },
    },
    email: {
      presence: { allowEmpty: false },
      email: true,
    },
    phone:{
      presence: { allowEmpty:false },
      length: { is: 10 }
    }
  };

  form.setValidationRules(constraints);
```

A working sample of **BetaForm** with controlled inputs and form validation can be found [here](https://locoworks.org/reusejs-react/input-group#betaform-sample)

export default ({ children }) => {
  return <SiteWrapper toc={toc}><div className="prose max-w-full mx-4 pb-10" >{children}</div></SiteWrapper>
};
